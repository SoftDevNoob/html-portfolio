<p>My name is Henrik (SoftDevNoob) <br />
I am 51 years old.</p> 
- but not for long....<br />
<br />
I come from Denmark (You know - The Milky way, Earth, Europe, Scandinavia, Denmark) <br />
I have played music since i was 6.<br />
I graduated from the Academy of Music in 2001 with piano as my first instrument.
I am also a trained truck mechanic, back in 1990. <br />
This summer I began to read about coding.<br />
By now I have a little knowlegde of the programming language C#. <br />
I am learning as much as I can about IT in general, and
I am about to make a decision to walk new pathss, despite my age.
I think it's really fun beeing able to learn new things. <br />
So in my spare time I am coding, learning to make websites, running, walking my dog.
I practice writing in english. Last time i did that, was in 1986 in the 9. grade. <br />
So please bare with me if my lack of english skills is notible.
